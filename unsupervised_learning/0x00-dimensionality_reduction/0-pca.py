    Function that performs PCA on a dataset
    Arguments:
    - X is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, d) where:
    - n is the number of data points
    - d is the number of dimensions in each point

    Validation:
    - all dimensions have a mean of 0 across all data points
    - var is the fraction of the variance that the PCA transformation
      should maintain

    - the weights matrix, W, that maintains var fraction of Xâ€˜s original
      variance W is a numpy.ndarray of shape (d, nd) where nd is the new
      dimensionality of the transformed X
